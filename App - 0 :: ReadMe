Instructions:

You get an array of arrays that have consecutuve lengths but one is missing.  For example, I have jagged array that has four total arrays.  The lengths of the arrays are 2, 3, 5, and 6.  The program needs to return the value 4 because that is the missing array length.

If the array containing the arrays is null or any array in the array is null or empty the program should return 0.

Stuff learned:

1) Jagged arrays
2) Refreshed my knowledge of reference types and null
3) Educated me on zero length arrays
