Name: Largest 5 digit number in a series

Objective:  When given a string, find and return the largest 5 digit integer

Review:  This kata was relatively easy and took me only about 30 minutes.  I use nested loops to create my 5 digit string, convert to int and then compare to find low value.


Lessons learned:

1) Math.Max()
  -given two numbers it will return  the largest
  
2) String.Substring()
    -returns a substring of a given string.  Two arguments are an index value as to where to start in the string and the length of      string it should return.
