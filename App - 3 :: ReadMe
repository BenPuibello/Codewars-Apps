Kata Title: Directions Reduction

Description:
Given an array of cardinal directions write an application that would remove elements given a relationship.  That relationship being if NORTH and SOUTH were together and EAST and WEST were together.  Visa versa for each.  For example, if I was given an array with ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"] the app must return ["WEST"].

My app:
I first converted the array to a List as that would be easier to add, remove and resize.  Then I build a second method to handle the removal of the elements if they matched.  Once completed I returned back the List back to the array.

Refactoring:
**after reviewing other solutions.
1) Use the .ToArray method on the List collection to convert the list to an array rather than use a loop.
