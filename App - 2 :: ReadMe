Determine Narcissistic Numbers.

Description:

Simple app where I'm given an integer and I have to determine if it is a Narcissistic Number or not.  To do so you have to use modulo and Math.Pow function.  I convert my given integer to an unsigned long which is the largest data type for integral numbers in C#.
